This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

This is my 2022 Portfolio. It consists of a header section, where you can find my social media and a little introduction. After that, we got the about section, where I tell you a little about myself and my journey, also where you can find my resume. Next, we have the experience section where I explain in detail where I've worked and what I've done there. Then, we have the skills section where I show you the skills that I have aquired. Then, we have the projects section, where I show the projects that I have built and a information about the project. Lastly, we have the contact me page, where you can send a message through the form that I've built.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
